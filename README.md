# Chicago Crime and Safety

## About

This project investigates the differences between commonly held notions of safety and actual safety in Chicago. It looks at common culutral claims as well as [Streetscore Data](http://streetscore.media.mit.edu/about.html) and compares them to actual crime data from the City of Chicago Open Data Portal. These relationships are explored visually through time and space using static data visualizations generated using ggplot with R. All code and files for the project are available in the repo, except for the raw crime data dump from the Chicago Open Data Portal, as it exceeds GitHub's file size limit.
